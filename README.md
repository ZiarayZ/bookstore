# One of my university assignments

Uploaded all of it here.
There are admin pages, only accessable through my database connection.
In "functions.php" there is the function "getConnetion()" this function connects to the database.
The details to connect to said database have been removed. (username and password)
There needs to be a "sessionData" folder with these pages as well.
