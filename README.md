# One of my university assignments

Uploaded all of it here.<br />
There are admin pages, only accessable through my database connection.<br />
In "functions.php" there is the function "getConnetion()" this function connects to the database.<br />
The details to connect to said database have been removed. (username and password)<br />
There needs to be a "sessionData" folder with these pages as well.<br />
